// You may wonder why don't I use `pre-merge-commit`. The answer is ‚Äì
// this crap "can be bypassed with the --no-verify option". This is for
// starters.
// Then "if the merge cannot be carried out automatically,
// the conflicts need to be resolved and the result committed separately
// ... this hook will not be executed, but the pre-commit hook will,
// if it is enabled.".
// So we come to `pre-commit` hook, you might think. But no, `pre-commit`
// hook "can be bypassed with the --no-verify option."
